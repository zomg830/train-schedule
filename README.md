# train-schedule

# Overview

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulate time input information with Moment.js. The website also provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
